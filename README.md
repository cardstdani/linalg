# linalg

The goal of this Notebook is to provide interactive tools to visualize and understand Linear Algebra concepts. From scalar, vectors, and tensors, to vector spaces and diagonalization.

To do so, you will have access to a series of Python code cells with an editable input and its corresponding output. Each one of them mainly uses TensorFlow, NumPy and MatplotLib functionalities to generate plots, compute results and operate with the proper data structures required in this field.

Also, you can clone the Notebook into your own Google Account, or just make edits in the code to alter the cell outputs and examples.
